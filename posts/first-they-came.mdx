My Thoughts on the Ongoing Political Battle Between Harvard and the Current Administration:

As China rapidly ramps up investment in research and development—and as its universities begin to surpass American institutions in technological innovation and academic output (as seen in the surge of Chinese publications in Nature)—our own administration seems more focused on ideological battles than on supporting the institutions that fuel American progress.

Rather than empowering our universities, it is undermining their autonomy and threatening the academic freedoms that have long attracted global talent and sustained the United States’ leadership and hegemonic position on the world stage. These institutions are more than centers of learning—they are engines of progress and pillars of liberty. To weaken them is to erode the foundation of our democracy and global competitiveness.

Equally alarming is the administration’s approach to foreign policy. It claims to confront China’s growing influence, yet its actions have alienated our closest allies. As John Bolton pointed out:

> “If you want to deal with the Chinese, it would make sense to get together with Japan and Korea. Instead, we’re having a war with our friends and crippling our ability to respond effectively.”

Threatening allies as if they were adversaries may offer temporary economic leverage, but it carries long-term geopolitical costs. These nations aren’t freeloaders—they help maintain the dollar’s dominance and anchor the global coalition that contains authoritarian powers like Russia, Iran, and China. Undermining those partnerships weakens America’s global standing and, ultimately, our economic resilience.

None of this is to say we should ignore the realities of illegal immigration or the persistent trade deficits with Asia and Europe. Strong border policies and a more balanced trade strategy are important, especially as the national debt rises. But these goals should not come at the expense of civil liberties or institutional integrity. Wrongful deportations, intimidation of American citizens, and interference in universities’ intellectual independence are not signs of strength—they are symptoms of administrative overreach.

We are watching vital institutions—and vital alliances—being dismantled under the guise of control. We cannot afford to remain silent. We must speak out, before this path becomes irreversible.
