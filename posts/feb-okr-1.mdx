Goals I Set Before February Started: Have about 5+ people to review the blog and get feedback. Also, write at least one article to post on the blog.

As you can probably tell, I successfully launched my website, Simple Thinking, in February! Thereâ€™s still a lot to refineâ€”both in design and contentâ€”but overall, Iâ€™m pretty happy with how it turned out.

That said, I didnâ€™t quite hit my goal of getting feedback from five people. Most of my time ended up going into d:gging, my side project, which Iâ€™ve been building and plan to launch a full beta test for in March. So, to make up for it, Iâ€™ll be reaching out to four more people this month to gather more feedback and improve the site.

One friend (whoâ€™s honestly cracked at this stuff) already gave me some solid feedback for Simple Thinking, and Iâ€™m planning to use that to enhance the blog.

If you spot any bugs in the image above or run into any issues throughout March,
just know itâ€™s because Iâ€™ve been knee-deep in d:gging and havenâ€™t had the chance
to fix them yetâ€”so thanks for your patience! ðŸ˜†
