Lately, I've been thinking more about what I want to do after college.

One thing I've realized through the user interviews for our startup is that people are surprisingly open and willing to chat.

So this month, I want to branch out and interview people in the VC and startup space to learn more about the industry.

My goal is to interview at least 10 people by the end of the month.
