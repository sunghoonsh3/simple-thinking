Midway through my sophomore year at Notre Dame, amidst the whirlwind of assignments, lectures, and the ever-present buzz of campus life, I find myself momentarily still, engulfed in a period of reflection that feels almost alien in the dynamic pace of college existence. These reflective pauses might seem out of place, but they’re filled with crucial questions about the essence of my journey. I’m grappling with the age-old query: What is the purpose of life, and where do work and education fit within this vast existential tapestry?

At a cursory glance, these queries might appear overly ambitious for an ordinary college student like myself, preoccupied with looming deadlines and forthcoming exams. Nonetheless, these reflective moments lay the groundwork for a deeply personal yet universally shared quest. It’s an expedition not solely toward professional success or a rewarding career but towards meaning—a component that lends life its richness and vibrance.

### The Role of Education in the Quest for Meaning

The discord between liberal and technical education in defining education’s contribution to our search for meaning is palpable across the campus. Notre Dame emphasizes the significance of a liberal arts education in nurturing the “minds and hearts” of individuals equipped not just with analytical abilities but also with the capacity for ethical decision-making.

Programs like Beyond the Dome champion the notion that while liberal education might not directly prepare students for specific roles, it cultivates versatile skills valued by employers and is crucial for making informed decisions post-graduation.

Yet, there’s a prevailing view that education’s primary function is to furnish job-specific skills with tangible economic value. While I resist the notion that education’s sole purpose is vocational preparation, I acknowledge the tangible benefits of technical education in the job market. The financial burden of education compels individuals to seek specialized employment to manage their student loans.

Admittedly, I, too, am implicated in this dilemma. Despite my belief that education should be a life-preparation tool beyond workforce readiness, I often find myself studying subjects for grades rather than passion, swayed by perceived employer preferences. My internship choices, too, were influenced more by financial incentives than genuine interest. Such contradiction highlights the complex relationship between education, work, and the pursuit of meaning.

### Work as a Medium of Expression and Purpose

This brings us to the question of whether we should even attempt to derive meaning from work through our educational experiences. Opinions vary widely, with some viewing employment purely as an economic transaction and others as a “calling” where financial considerations, though important, are not paramount.

If we accept the former perspective, education becomes a means to specialize and secure well-paying jobs, irrespective of our passions. The latter view complicates the narrative, urging us to view education as a journey of self-discovery and alignment with our passions. The latter is challenging, as financial struggles remain, yet ideally, we should pursue what we love while still earning a sustainable income. As the writer Simone Stolozoff says, “Love, unfortunately, does not pay the bills,” after all.

Before college, I naively believed education was purely about exploring passions, independent of grades or job prospects. Discussions with Professor Bederman, however, revealed a different reality: education became a commodity for enhancing resumes, a stepping stone to prestigious jobs at firms like McKinsey or tech giants like Google.

Thus, to maintain my original stance, I was faced with a choice: pursue my passions and view education as a holistic journey, or chase financial gain by treating education as a skill-enhancing tool akin to a YouTube tutorial.

### The Intersection of Work and Education in the Search for Meaning

Being part of the Sheedy Family Program and Beyond the Dome gave me the autonomy to shape my decision. Through the series of monthly guest lectures, I saw the diverse ways Notre Dame graduates navigate their lives after college. It became clear that, despite varied experiences, a common thread emerged. Pursuing a passion is challenging and often encounters unforeseen obstacles, yet it’s a journey that circles back to what we genuinely love, proving to be rewarding. Embracing what you love might not lead to wealth, but it equips you with the strength to overcome adversity and find meaning in life.

I haven’t met anyone who regretted following their passion. They spoke a language of “passion,” “calling,” and “gift economy” and shared insights like philosophy graduates outearning computer science majors. Despite their diversity in expression, their message was unanimous: chase after what you enjoy.

Building on these insights, I had the unique opportunity to observe firsthand the effects of following one’s passions on happiness and job satisfaction during the SF business trek with fellow Sheedy students. Meeting with Notre Dame graduates employed at leading companies like Google, Apple, Meta, and EA Sports, I witnessed the tangible impact of pursuing one’s interests on an individual’s quality of life. Despite the short duration of our interactions, it was unmistakably clear that finding purpose in one’s work and achieving a healthy work-life balance were key factors contributing to their overall well-being. The “work-life balance” became a hot topic among our group, as the stark distinction between the companies, with different work hours and personal lives, showed how one felt about the companies.

Notably, each company showcased unique ways to support their employees’ well-being and aspirations.

Meta impressed us with its generous provisions of free meals, snacks, and a gaming room, illustrating a commitment to employee satisfaction and stress relief. During our visit, we discussed with employees their views on social media’s role in today’s society, the steps Meta takes to ensure a safe online environment, and how they see their contributions aligning with the company’s goals. The employees radiated confidence in Meta’s vision and genuinely addressed our inquiries.

Google stood out for its wide range of free culinary options and notably generous parental leave policies, which underline a focus on employee welfare and flexibility in pursuing personal goals. The interactions we had made it clear that Google pushes its employees to excel, yet it also places great importance on accommodating their individual needs and aspirations. As one noted, “You cannot be successful in every avenue, and Google supports its employees in reaching their goals across different life aspects.”

EA Sports emphasized a familial company culture and a sincere interest in employee growth. The company advocates for internal passion projects and offers training and support for career transitions, which resonated deeply with me. A standout moment was our chance to observe a voice recording session for The Sims. It was a joy to see the voice actors, with their enthusiasm and talent, breathe life into the game. Some humorously remarked they’d buy the game to appreciate those voice performances again!

Apple embraces a cautious yet deliberate ethos, emphasizing the paramount importance of security and the cultivation of specialized expertise among its workforce. It was notably fascinating to learn that employees sometimes grapple with understanding the alignment of their contributions with the broader objectives and vision of Apple’s expansive product ecosystem, for they sometimes were unaware of how their product contributed to the overall picture during the production stage. We also engaged in a thought-provoking discussion regarding the significance of liberal arts education within the tech industry. The consensus underscored that the analytical prowess and critical thinking skills nurtured through a liberal arts background significantly bolster employees’ capabilities, enabling them to navigate and innovate within their professional landscapes effectively.

After these experiences, I decided to prioritize what I love during my university years, even if it leads to tougher courses and possibly lower grades or pushes me beyond the classroom’s confines. While this choice might not open doors to giants like Apple or Meta, it ensures I remain true to my passions. Who can say what the future holds? The most unexpected twists often unveil the most incredible opportunities, a truth I’ve come to appreciate in my university journey.

Therefore, my reflection on education and work concludes with a belief in pursuing education as a path to passion, not merely a means to a job. It’s about more than just landing a job at a prestigious company; it’s the essence of engaging deeply with learning and life, seeking meaning beyond titles and conventional measures of success.

In the following article, I will discuss what I believe in leading a purposeful life and work, reflecting on some of the guest speaker talks and books I’ve encountered at Notre Dame.
