How do you find a person of interest on LinkedIn (whether that be finding a mentor, a potential client, or someone who shares your professional goals)?

Like many of you, I often send LinkedIn messages (or more accurately, connection requests), and I try my best to convey my message within the 300-character limit. I repeatedly revise these messages based on the response rate to increase the chances of capturing the attention of the person I'm interested in. This year, I had to send out many of these messages while searching for an internship, and it took me a lot of time to get it right.

Today, in the go-to-market strategy class I am taking at Notre Dame, I was introduced to a tool called [Boardy](https://www.boardy.ai/), and it was a “wow” moment for me. I've heard about the growing field of AI voice agents, but I hadn't seen it applied in real life to the quality I had imagined. Boardy, however, far exceeded my expectations with its intentional conversational pauses, human-like intonations, and overall natural feel.

So, what exactly is Boardy?

If you message Boardy on LinkedIn, it calls you within 30 seconds. It then asks you a series of questions to understand what you're looking for and finds a person of interest within its network. After identifying a potential match, Boardy contacts that person to see if they are open to connecting with you. If both parties express interest, you get connected.

For instance, during class, a fellow student ran a trial with Boardy. The tool asked her about her interests, how she heard about Boardy, and what she envisions for her future career. She mentioned that she learned about Boardy through Logan, our professor, and that she was interested in financial planning (if I remember correctly). Boardy then asked whether she would like to connect with someone who could provide mentorship in that field.

Boardy proceeded to search its network and suggested a student at Cornell with similar interests who might be able to offer guidance.

Boardy seems to avoid recommending individuals too high up the chain (e.g., the CEO of an AI startup). Instead, it tends to connect you with people who are in a similar stage or slightly ahead of you, especially when it comes to mentorship.

This tool has the potential to simplify the process of finding meaningful connections
on LinkedIn and might save you a lot of time compared to crafting and sending countless
cold messages. If you're looking for a mentor or someone to collaborate with, Boardy
might be worth trying out.
