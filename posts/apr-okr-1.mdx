I've been doing a lot of thinking about what I should be doing after I graduate. I was really into entrepreneurship and startups, so I wanted to either start my own thing, become a VC, or work at an early-stage startup. But honestly, I still kinda wanted to work at FAANG too.

It’s a dream for a lot of CS majors, right? But with AI blowing up, I've been thinking — there might be less need for regular software engineers soon. And if I have to shift, might as well go deep into AI.

Then I thought: if I’m gonna learn all this AI stuff anyway, and big tech’s just gonna keep eating the world with it, why not be the one building at the frontier instead?

So I applied to a bunch of startup fellowships — Kleiner Perkins, BCV Labs, Bessemer Venture Fellows — and somehow got in. Super grateful. But I didn’t just want to work at someone else's startup.

That’s when I reached out to Boris, one of my co-founders, to learn more about the Telora Fellowship — where you get to explore your own startup idea for the summer.

Now, I'm brainstorming ideas with Boris and Hamza (ex-Telora fellow at FSU and CMU AI student).

We’ve got important interviews coming up this month and will meet up in Miami to jam on it in person.

Don’t wanna blow this once-in-a-lifetime shot. Let's prep hard and make it count.

While I wouldn't frame securing these fundings as my main goal, given that OKRs focus on measurable success, I would like to secure at least one funding from these opportunities.
