Goals I Set Before February Started: Make sure to complete 80% of my habits (e.g. hit gym 4 times a week).

I kind of dropped the ball on this one. I did track some of my habits and stuck to quite a few since they’re already part of my routine, but I definitely didn’t hit the 80% mark.

February was a busy month, but I don’t want to use that as an excuse. Realistically, I probably completed about 30-40% of what I planned. That said, I still spent a lot of time being productive in other areas, so I’m not too mad about it.

For March, I’m going to adjust my habits to make them more achievable and actually hold myself accountable for tracking them properly.
