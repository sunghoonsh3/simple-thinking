Goals I Set Before February Started: Have about 5+ cs students to use D:gging and get feedback.

I’ve spent a lot of time working on d:gging this month, aiming to launch it as soon as possible. Initially, I planned for a February release, but the project turned out to be much bigger than expected. Now, I’m targeting a March launch.

For some context, d:gging is an AI model—similar to ChatGPT—that helps Notre Dame students find the right classes. The idea came from my own struggles with course registration. I always thought college was about studying what truly interests you, so I picked classes purely based on curiosity. Looking back, that wasn’t the smartest move. My freshman year, I took 21 credits, got wrecked GPA-wise, but had a blast tackling difficult subjects. Unfortunately, employers (and many people in general) seem to care more about numbers than passion.

That made me realize: balancing interesting yet manageable classes is a real challenge for students. Many want to push themselves without destroying their GPA or burning out, which is completely valid and, honestly, the smart choice.

_No professor found on RateMyProfessor for Notre Dame Computer Science Professor_

Right now, students rely on RateMyProfessor, NOVO, and Path Search to piece together their schedule. The process is clunky—you find a class on Path Search, look up the professor on RateMyProfessor, then finalize everything on NOVO. Plus, class descriptions are long and vague, some professors are infamous for never giving A’s, and if there’s no RateMyProfessor review, you’re stuck asking friends (who might not even have a clue). If you’re a CS major needing an arts class and your CS friends are just as lost, it’s basically a coin toss.

That’s where d:gging comes in. It will replace all that hassle—completely free for students. The only catch? To use it, you’ll need to submit at least three course reviews from the previous semester. This helps build a far better feedback system than RateMyProfessor.

Key features of d:gging will be:

**1. Smart search**

Filter classes by requirements, professor difficulty, course rating, and more.

**2. Personalized recommendations**

Ask things like “I need a CS elective beyond CS 30XXX. Any cybersecurity-related options?” or “I want a low-stress arts class, maybe ceramics—any easy recs?”

With d:gging, course registration will finally make sense.
